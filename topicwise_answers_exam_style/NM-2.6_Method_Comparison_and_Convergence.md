# NM-2.6 · Method Comparison & Convergence

Every block below is copied from `../answers_exam_style/`, which is the

for character, as the one it came from.


### [2020 Q.2(a)]

**Question.** Define roots of an equation. List the comparisons among bisection, secant, false position and Newton-Raphson methods.

**Solution.**

**Root of an equation.** A **root** of $f(x) = 0$ is a value $x^*$ with
$f(x^*) = 0$. The graph of $f$ crosses or touches the $x$-axis at $x^*$.

A root is **simple** if $f'(x^*) \ne 0$, and **multiple** (or repeated) if
$f'(x^*) = 0$. The distinction matters because the methods below all assume a
simple root; a repeated root makes their convergence much slower.

A root is **explicit** if it can be written in closed form, and **implicit** if
it can only be found numerically. $\sqrt{2}$ is explicit. The root of
$x^5 - x - 1 = 0$ is implicit.

**The four methods compared.**

| | Bisection | False position | Secant | Newton-Raphson |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Type | Bracketing | Bracketing | Open | Open |
| Needs $f'$ | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Needs a sign change | **Yes** | **Yes** | No | No |
| Information used | Endpoints only | Endpoints, keeps one fixed | Last **two** points | Value **and** slope at one point |
| New point from | Midpoint | Chord crossing | Chord through last two | Tangent at last point |
| Convergence order | 1 (linear) | 1, often faster | 1.618 (golden ratio) | **2 (quadratic)** |
| Starts from | $a_0$ | $a_0$ | $x_0, x_1$ | $x_0$ only |
| Guaranteed | **Yes**, from any valid bracket | **Yes** | No | No |
| Function calls per step | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 (value and derivative) |
| Weakness | Slow, and halves the interval | Stalls on one side for strong convexity | Can diverge, can lose the bracket | Sensitive to the start |

**How they relate.** They form a ladder from safest to fastest.

- **Bisection** is the safety net. It only needs a sign change, and it can never
  fail. That guarantee is why it survives in production codes.
- **False position** uses the same bracket but wastes it, because it keeps only
  one endpoint and lets the other run away. Faster than bisection, but it stalls
  on strongly convex functions.
- **Secant** throws the bracket away and fits a line through the last two
  points. The order $1.618$ is better than the labels "linear" suggest.
- **Newton** throws away the history except one point and uses the slope. It
  converges quadratically, so it is the method of choice when $f'$ is available
  and the start is good.

**The practical rule.** Keep a bracket. Try Newton. If a step leaves the
bracket, take a bisection step instead. This hybrid keeps Newton's speed and
bisection's guarantee, and it is what real root finders do. See the worked
warning in 2021 Q.7(b) and 2023 Q.5(c) for what happens without it.

$$
\boxed{\text{Bracketing methods are safe and slow; open methods are fast and unguaranteed}}
$$
